# Honeydew-List-App

An Android real-time to-do list app targeted at families and couples to create a reward system for doing chores. Friended users can create a list of tasks for the users on their friends list to complete, and they are given digital melons as a reward. Melons received from another user can be redeemed for rewards set by the same user.
